###Introduction
What will we accomplish with this project?
What design patterns will be used?
How are inputs ingested, transformed, and processed?

###Classes
Describe each class.

###Prototypes/Research
Test the **waitpid()**, **execvp()**, and **fork()** functions. How?
- Investigate each one individually
- Create a prototype function to observe how they function together
- Try executing commands
- Create a small prototype parser for user input
  - Needs to compile, but can have bugs or be incomplete
  - It should reflect what parsing method should be used
- Put it all in a prototype/ directory
Then, describe your findings and talk about how we plan to use them in the assignment!
Finally, perform some testing with connectors and write any notes about those results.

###Development and Testing Roadmap
Create an **ORDERED LIST** of development tasks that need to be fulfilled before the system can be completed. This should include both unit and integration testing. Create a GitHub Issue and assign it to a person who is planning on completing it. These are simply a plan of action, and some tasks may be too hard, or perhaps additional tasks may be necessary to complete.

#####Oh, and one more thing...
Don't think just about how the assignment is now, think about how it can be expanded, and ensure your design is well positioned to adopt these changes. This is very important! Successful projects usually have new functions added and old functions modified.
